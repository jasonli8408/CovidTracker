#this is a project that educates users on path finding algorithms, we included the following algorithms:

    A*
    Dijkstra
    Bi-directional
    Depth first search
    BFS search

#To use this application:

    hold s on keyboard to place a starting point
    hold e on keyboard to place the ending point
    hold b, and drag the mouse across the grid to create your own obstables to challenge the path finding algorithms. Or simply select "make maze" button to randmoly generate a maze.
    select desired algorithms from the drop box and run the find path algorithms using the find path button.
    one can also remove obstables or remove everything by selecting the corresponding buttons.

To demonstrate the process of the algorithms, we employed the observer pattern to show the exploration of process at each iteration. This is a very effective and concise way to visually demonstrate how each algorithms differ in terms of exploation process and run time.

addition note :

    if the user desires to slow down the process of the algorithms at each iteration, simply uncomment timer delay code in the update method in the GUI class
